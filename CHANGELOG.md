## [Unreleased]

_Phase 3 (PDF anchoring) in progress. Next: pdf.js viewer surface (M2)._

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **PDF anchoring foundation (Phase 3, M1)** — no UI yet:
  - IndexedDB **schema v2**: a new `files` store for binary payloads (PDF bytes), reached via a new
    `FileRepository`. `migrations[1]` is untouched; `migrations[2]` appends the store.
  - Pure **PDF anchoring core** (`src/core/anchoring/pdf.ts`) mirroring the web anchoring module:
    `createPdfAnchor` / `resolvePdfAnchor` store rectangles as **fractions (0–1) of the page box**, so
    anchors are invariant to zoom and render DPR. Unit-tested (round-trip + zoom-invariance).
  - Messages `files/put` / `files/get` (bytes cross the messaging boundary as **base64**, since
    `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` is JSON-serialised), plus `annotations/listByDocument` and
    `annotations/delete`. Router cases + tests.
  - `'pdf'` added to `DocumentType`; a `StoredFile` model type.

### Notes

- 83 unit tests (base64 round-trip, PDF anchoring, new router routes, schema-v2 store list).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Citation styles view (Phase 2, M6)**: a two-column styles workspace — a list of style profiles
  (APA, Chicago, Harvard seeded on first run) and a lightweight rule editor: citation system
  (author–date / footnote), a maximum-authors stepper, and Include DOI / URL / issue toggles, with a
  **live preview** that reformats one- and four-author samples as the rules change.
- Create new style profiles and **Save** edits, persisted via the new `citationStyles/put` message.
- A "Full editor" affordance flags the complete CSL rule editor coming in Phase 4.

### Notes

- This completes the Phase 2 core: Dashboard shell, Overview + Kanban, Documents, References + DOI
  import, Annotations, and Citation styles. Team and the full CSL editor remain deferred by design.
- 71 unit tests and 7 dashboard E2E specs (shell, routing, Documents filter, References + import
  form, Annotations review status, Kanban keyboard move, and a persisted citation-style edit).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Annotations view (Phase 2, M5)**: a searchable, filterable list of the project's notes — each
  card shows the anchor locator (a quote snippet or PDF page), the source document line, the quoted
  note body, a review-status tag, and its tags, plus a **Cite** action that copies the source's
  citation.
- **Review workflow**: the status tag opens a popover to move a note through
  draft → accepted → in report → rejected, persisted via the new `annotations/put` message.
- Filter chips for All / Draft / Accepted / In report / Rejected.

### Notes

- 71 unit tests (router `annotations/put` round-trip) and a new E2E asserting a review-status change
  persists across a reload.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **References view + DOI import (Phase 2, M4)**: a table of the project's bibliographic records —
  formatted reference line, DOI, a CSL type chip, an origin tag (Extracted / Zotero / Manual), the
  "used in" outputs, and a copy-citation action (via `citations/reference`).
- **Import by DOI**: a use-case (`importReferenceByDoi`) resolves a DOI to CSL-JSON through doi.org
  content negotiation and stores it as a Reference, deduping by DOI. The import popover offers DOI
  today (gated behind an optional host-permission request for doi.org / crossref / datacite);
  Zotero / BibTeX / RIS are shown as "Soon".
- Messages `references/listByProject`, `references/put`, `references/importByDoi` (router + tests).
  No schema change — the `references` store already exists.

### Notes

- 71 unit tests (new `references` use-case suite + router coverage) and a new E2E asserting the
  References table renders and the DOI import form opens.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Documents view (Phase 2, M3)**: a searchable, filterable table of the project's sources — live
  search over title/author/DOI, status filter chips with live counts, per-row Section chip, a Status
  pill that opens the shared "Move to" popover, a notes count, and an external-link action to the
  source's DOI. Empty and no-match states included.

### Notes

- Reuses the side-panel pure view-model (`filterDocuments`, `statusCounts`) — no duplicated logic.
- New E2E asserting the Documents search filters the table.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Overview + Kanban board (Phase 2, M2)**: the Overview route now shows four project stat tiles
  (Sources, Analysed with % of corpus reviewed, Annotations with count included in the report, and
  the active citation Style) above a four-column workflow **Kanban board**.
- Kanban cards move between workflow stages by **drag-and-drop** and by **keyboard** (focus a card,
  ← / → to advance/retreat, Enter to open the status popover); moves persist via `documents/put`
  and update the tiles, with a flash highlight and a toast.
- Shared **status popover** ("Move to") that flips to stay on-screen, reused by later views.
- **Export bibliography** action copies the project bibliography to the clipboard via
  `citations/bibliography`.
- Read-only messages `annotations/listByProject` and `citationStyles/list` (router + tests) powering
  the annotation/style tiles and the nav count badges. No schema change — the stores already exist.

### Notes

- 64 unit tests (router coverage for the two new routes) and a new E2E asserting a keyboard Kanban
  move persists across a reload.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Dashboard app-shell (Phase 2, M1)** on the options page: sidebar with wordmark, project
  switcher (lists projects, switches active, creates new ones) and a Workspace nav (Overview,
  Documents, Annotations, References, Citation styles) with live count badges; sticky topbar with
  per-route title/subtitle; a view router; and a responsive off-canvas drawer (≤880px) with scrim
  and Escape-to-close.
- Dashboard-local design system in `src/options/dashboard.css` — the full token + component set
  ported from the design mock (warm-neutral light theme, terracotta accent, print-scholarly type).
  The side panel's `panel.css` is untouched.
- Pure, unit-tested dashboard view-model (`src/options/view-model.ts`) reusing the side-panel status
  vocabulary; routes, titles and status colours (6 new tests, 62 total).
- **Credit footer** on the dashboard (not the side panel): attribution segments + app version read
  from the manifest at runtime.
- E2E coverage: the dashboard loads in headed Chromium, the project switcher shows a seeded project,
  and nav routing updates the topbar title.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- End-to-end tests (Playwright) that load the built extension into a headed Chromium: the side
  panel renders and seeds a default project, and a filed document flows through
  messaging → router → IndexedDB → UI with updated progress.
- CI job running the E2E suite under xvfb.

### Notes

- Credit-footer decision: placed on the Phase 2 Dashboard only, not the space-constrained side
  panel.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Side Panel UI** ported from the design prototype: capture card, reading list grouped by
  workflow status with search and status filter, and a review-progress footer — wired to the
  service worker and IndexedDB.
- First-run seeding of a default project; capture the active tab into the reading list
  (deduplicated by DOI).
- One-click citation copy: in-text/bibliography for the filed page, per-source in-text citation
  from the list, and a project-wide bibliography.
- Shared design tokens and component styles extracted to `panel.css`; accessibility preserved
  (roles, keyboard, reduced-motion) with stable `data-od-id` hooks.
- `citations/document` message to cite any listed source. Pure side-panel view-model
  (filter/group/progress) unit-tested (56 tests total).

### Notes

- Bundling OFL web fonts (serif display + mono) for cross-platform visual fidelity is a tracked
  follow-up; the current stack degrades gracefully.

## [0.0.5] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- Citation formatting via citeproc-js (bundled locally through citation-js): `CitationFormatter`
  port and `CiteJsFormatter` adapter, with the en-US locale bundled.
- Five base styles: APA, Harvard, and Vancouver (built-in) plus Chicago author-date and MLA
  (vendored CSL under `src/assets/csl`, registered at runtime).
- Citation use-cases (`formatProjectBibliography`, `formatReferenceCitation`) and
  `citations/bibliography` / `citations/reference` messages, formatting from stored `cslData`.
- Golden-file tests pinning exact output for 4 styles × 1/3/4-author references (48 tests total).

### Changed

- Router now takes structured deps (`{ capture, formatter }`); the service worker injects the
  citeproc formatter.

## [0.0.4] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- Pure bibliographic metadata extraction: DOI detection/normalisation, `citation_*`/Dublin Core
  meta-tag reading, year parsing, and CSL-JSON building.
- Web-page anchoring (`createWebAnchor`/`resolveWebAnchor`) using the W3C model — text-quote →
  text-position → css fallback — via the Hypothesis `dom-anchor-*` libraries; re-anchors after
  content shifts.
- Capture use-case: builds a Document + linked Reference and deduplicates by DOI within a project
  (deterministic, injected id/clock).
- `capture/page` message wired through the router; self-contained page scanner injected into the
  active tab (`activeTab` + `scripting`, no persistent host access) plus side-panel capture glue.
- Tests: metadata, anchoring (jsdom, incl. re-anchor), page scan, and capture dedup (31 tests total).

## [0.0.3] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- Typed message contract (`MessageMap`) shared by UI and service worker.
- Pure message router (`handleRequest`) dispatching requests to repository operations,
  unit-tested independently of `chrome.*`.
- `chrome.runtime` messaging adapter: typed `sendRequest` client and `registerMessageRouter`
  server binding, with lazy cold-start repository resolution.
- Service worker wired to the router with a cached IndexedDB handle.
- Round-trip tests over a mocked `chrome.runtime` (write→read a document end to end); 17 tests total.

## [0.0.2] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- Domain-core model types mirroring the data model (Project, Document, Annotation,
  Reference, CitationStyle, User), including the multi-strategy `Anchor` (web + PDF).
- Repository ports (storage contract) with no IndexedDB/`chrome.*` leakage.
- IndexedDB adapter via `idb`: versioned schema, ordered migrations, object stores and
  indexes (incl. `[projectId, metadata.doi]` for capture-time deduplication).
- DOI-aware `findByDoi` for documents and references (case- and `doi.org`-prefix insensitive).
- Unit tests (`fake-indexeddb`): CRUD, project isolation, DOI dedup, migration ordering (11 tests).

## [0.0.1] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- Initial project scaffold: MV3 manifest via `@crxjs/vite-plugin`, TypeScript (strict), Vite build.
- Background service worker, side panel, and options-page stubs.
- Domain-core seed (`workflow` statuses) with Vitest unit tests.
- Tooling: ESLint (flat config), Prettier, EditorConfig, Vitest + v8 coverage.
- GitHub Actions CI: typecheck → lint → unit → build.
