# Project Status & Resume Plan

_Last updated: 2026-07-24 — Phase 4 complete and merged; Phase 5 started (M1 of 4 done)._

## Where we are

**Phase 4 (Citation style editor) is complete and merged to `main`.** **Phase 5 (Collaboration &
Sync) is in progress** — M1 (members & roles) shipped; M2–M4 remain.

- **Repo:** https://github.com/AmigoUK/Research-Chrome-Extension
- **Branch state:** everything through **v0.15.0 is on `main`** (Phases 1–5 M1). No unmerged work.
- **Releases:** v0.15.0 (Phase 5 M1); v0.13.0 → v0.14.0 Phase 4; v0.8.0 → v0.12.0 Phase 3;
  v0.2.0 → v0.7.0 Phase 2; v0.0.1 → v0.1.1 Phase 1.
- **CI:** GitHub Actions — typecheck → lint → unit → build, plus an E2E job (Playwright under xvfb).
- **Tests:** 139 unit + 16 E2E (5 PDF viewer + 9 dashboard + 2 side panel), all green.

### Phase 5 — scope decision (agreed with the user, 2026-07-24)

**Local-first, no backend.** The roadmap's third sync mode (self-hosted backend) is explicitly out of
scope: it would mean building a server with auth, an API and real-time sync, which is not this repo.
Consequences carried through the code and the UI:

- Roles are **advisory** and the Team view says so in plain words — every collaborator holds a full
  copy of the project in their own IndexedDB, so nothing can enforce a role.
- "Invite" creates a local pending member; nothing is sent. It travels in the next shared snapshot.
- The snapshot (M4) is a portable JSON file with **optional password encryption** (WebCrypto
  AES-GCM + PBKDF2): empty password → plain JSON for backup/inspection, password → encrypted file.

### Phase 5 milestones

| Milestone | Version | State |
|---|---|---|
| M1 — Members & roles: capability matrix (`src/core/model/roles.ts`), membership use-cases, Team view (6th nav item), `members/*` + `users/*` messages | v0.15.0 | ✅ |
| M2 — Activity feed: `ActivityEvent` entity, IDB **schema v3**, recording hooks for status / annotation / reference / member / sync events, day-grouped feed with kind filters | — | ⬜ |
| M3 — Comment threads: anchored threads on documents & annotations, reply / resolve, Comments tab | — | ⬜ |
| M4 — Snapshot export/import: portable JSON, optional AES-GCM password, merge on import with **hard DOI dedup**, sync-mode selector (local / file; backend shown as unavailable) | — | ⬜ |

M2 and M3 add the tab bar (Activity / Comments / Members) the design mock has; M1 deliberately ships
the Members view without dead tabs.

### Phase 4 delivered (verified in headed Chromium + screenshots)

| Milestone | Version | State |
|---|---|---|
| M1 — Rule-driven CSL engine: `compileCsl` / `applyRulesToItem`, `formatWithStyle`, `citations/preview`, five vendored base CSL | v0.13.0 | ✅ |
| M2–M4 — Full-screen editor (profile rail, 5 rule groups, live citeproc preview, CSL-override tab, export/duplicate/delete) + `styleId` wired into every copy path | v0.14.0 | ✅ |

Two design decisions worth remembering: the **citation system is declared by the base CSL style**
(`<category citation-format="…"/>`), so the Author–date / Footnote / Numeric control switches the
base style rather than pretending to convert one — which is why **Chicago (notes & bibliography)** is
now vendored. And rules land through three levers: CSL attribute injection (names, page label),
CSL-JSON reshaping (identifiers, FOI / legal templates) and one rendered-text rewrite (`doi:` form).

### Phase 3 delivered (verified end-to-end in headed Chromium + screenshots)

| Milestone | Version | State |
|---|---|---|
| M1 — File store (IDB schema v2) + pure PDF anchoring core (fraction rects) | v0.8.0 | ✅ |
| M2 — pdf.js reader surface (`src/pdfviewer/`): canvas render, zoom, page nav | v0.9.0 | ✅ |
| M3 — Text anchoring (text-layer select → highlight) + annotations rail | v0.10.0 | ✅ |
| M4 — Region anchoring (drag a rectangle) | v0.11.0 | ✅ |
| M5 — Ingestion UX (dashboard "Add PDF" upload + "Open in reader" / URL fetch) | v0.12.0 | ✅ |

`pdfjs-dist` bundled locally with its ESM worker (default MV3 CSP intact; worker/viewer web-accessible;
viewer is a Rollup input). Anchors stored as fraction rects → invariant to zoom/DPR. File bytes cross
the messaging channel as base64. IndexedDB bumped to v2 (`files` store); `migrations[1]` untouched.

### Phase 2 recap (shipped, on `main`)

Dashboard shell · Overview + Kanban · Documents · References + DOI import · Annotations · Citation
styles (v0.2.0–v0.7.0). Dashboard-local CSS; side panel untouched.

### Deferred by design (not blocking)

- **Team view** remains deferred (the full CSL rule editor shipped in Phase 4).
- `CitationStyle.cslOverride` is still not persisted — the override object is generated on demand for
  the editor's code view; storing it would only duplicate `userRules`.
- Per-annotation "section" + link-to-section (mock nicety) omitted — the domain `Annotation` has no
  section field.
- **DOI import** and **open-PDF-by-URL** real-network round trips need a runtime host-permission grant
  and were not exercised in headless CI (both unit-tested / covered by seeded-path E2E).
- Prior Phase 1 follow-ups still stand (dev-dep dependabot alerts, OFL web fonts).

### Delivered (verified end-to-end in real Chrome)

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| MV3 scaffold, least-privilege perms (`sidePanel` + optional hosts) | ✅ |
| IndexedDB storage (idb, versioned schema, migrations, DOI dedup) | ✅ |
| Typed UI↔SW messaging + pure router | ✅ |
| Capture: metadata extraction, W3C web anchoring, DOI dedup | ✅ |
| CSL citations via citeproc-js — APA/Harvard/Vancouver/Chicago/MLA (13 golden tests) | ✅ |
| Side Panel UI (capture card, status pipeline reading list, citation copy) | ✅ |
| E2E (extension loaded in headed Chromium) | ✅ |

### Architecture

Ports & adapters: pure domain core in `src/core` (no `chrome.*`), thin adapters in
`src/adapters`. Surfaces in `src/background` (service worker), `src/sidepanel`, `src/options`
(stub).

## Known follow-ups (not blocking)

1. **Dev-dep audit** — 5 dependabot alerts, all in dev tooling (`@crxjs` beta transitive deps).
   `npm audit --omit=dev` = **0 production vulnerabilities**. `audit fix --force` deferred to avoid
   breaking the build; revisit when @crxjs leaves beta.
2. **OFL web fonts** — the side panel uses a graceful system-font stack; bundling licensed OFL
   serif + mono for cross-platform visual fidelity is a small polish task.
3. **Per-source status control** — the reading list advances status by click-cycling; the
   prototype's "move to" popover is a nicety for later.

## Resume plan — next steps

**Continue Phase 5 at M2 (activity feed).** Nothing is half-finished: `main` is green at v0.15.0 and
the working tree is clean. M2 starts with the domain entity and the IDB migration:

1. `ActivityEvent { id, projectId, actorUserId, kind, summary, entityId?, from?, to?, createdAt }`
   in `src/core/model/types.ts`; `kind` covers status / annotation / comment / reference / member /
   sync (the mock's filter chips).
2. IDB **schema v3** — an `activity` store keyed by `id` with a `projectId` index. Follow
   `src/adapters/idb/schema.ts`: add `migrations[3]`, never touch `migrations[1]`/`[2]`.
3. Record events where the change already happens (the router cases and `src/core/usecases/*`), not
   in the UI — a change made from the side panel must show up in the feed too.
4. Team view gains the tab bar; Activity tab renders day-grouped events with the kind filters and a
   before→after diff for status and role changes.

**Smaller follow-ons in the citation area:** bundle size (the Chicago notes CSL is 243 kB raw —
lazy-loading base styles from `web_accessible_resources` would trim the SW), and importing a
third-party `.csl` file as a base style.

### How to resume

```
/loop work through Phase 5 (collaboration & sync) milestones M2–M4, one milestone per iteration, full loop each time
```

Environment is ready: Node 22, deps installed, `gh` authenticated with `workflow` scope, Playwright
Chromium installed, xvfb available. Run `npm run dev` to load the extension, `npm test` for units,
`npm run test:e2e` for E2E.
